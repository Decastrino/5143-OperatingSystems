## Cloud Computing / Cloud OS

- Define Cloud Computing
- Define Cloud OS
- Compare the two
- Likely background terminology that needs defined:
    - Virtualization
    - Virtual Machines
    - bootloading
    - hypervisor
    - etc.
- Give some examples of existing platforms (e.g. http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/free-cloud-os/ )
- You should discuss some typical OS topics as applied to Cloud OS. You do not have to cover all of them, but any sub-topic that is relevant should be covered. 
    - Virtual Memory
    - Caching
    - File System
    - Command Line Interface
    - Threading
    - Interrupts
- What can Cloud OS's be used as a solution for?
- What should Cloud OS's NOT be used for.

## Embedded Systems

- Define Embedded system
- Components of an embedded system:
    - hardware
    - application software
    - RTOS (real time operating system)
- Any background terminology should be defined around here.
- Characteristics of an Embedded system (e.g. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/embedded_systems/es_overview.htm)
- Where are **embedded systems** used? Give the most popular examples.
- What are the characteristics of an embedded system **Operating System**
- Compare Embedded OS to a Network OS (e.g. http://smallbusiness.chron.com/network-operating-systems-vs-embedded-operating-systems-46508.html) 
- Give some examples of existing platforms (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_operating_systems#Embedded)
- You should discuss some typical OS topics as applied to Embedded OS. You do not have to cover all of them, but any sub-topic that is relevant should be covered. 
    - Virtual Memory
    - Caching
    - File System
    - Command Line Interface
    - Threading
    - Interrupts
- What are Embedded OS's be used as a solution for?
- What should Embedded OS's NOT be used for?

## Virtual Desktops as a Service (Daas vs VDI etc.)

- Define Virtual Desktop (big picture / overview)
- Likely background terminology that needs defined:
    - Local desktop virtualization vs Remote desktop virtualization
    - Daas
    - VDI
    - Virtual Machine
    - etc.
- Give some examples of existing Virtual Desktop Providers (e.g. http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/desktop-as-a-service-providers,2-838.html 
- Pros and Cons of VDI (http://www.pcworld.com/article/252314/the_pros_and_cons_of_using_virtual_desktop_infrastructure.html)
- Discuss Desktop as a Service vs. VDI (http://patriot-tech.com/blog/2015/01/28/desktop-service-vs-vdi-whats-difference/)
- You should discuss some typical OS topics as applied to Cloud OS. You do not have to cover all of them, but any sub-topic that is relevant should be covered. 
    - Virtual Memory
    - Caching
    - File System
    - Command Line Interface
    - Threading
    - Interrupts
- When is Daas or VDI a good solution.
- When is Daas or VDI a NOT a good solution.

## Distributed File Systems

- Waht is a File System?
- What is a Distributed File System?
- Clarify any differences with the following (if any):
    - Clustered File System
    - Network Attached Storage
    - Parallel File System
- Likely background terminology that needs defined:
    - Distributed
    - Parallel
    - Serialization
    - Packet Loss
    - Block Size
    - Concurrency Control
    - etc.
- Some things that may be addressed:
    - cloud based storage
    - redundancy
    - security
    - concurrency
    - performance
    - i/o speed (reading writing to a network drive)
- You should discuss some typical OS topics as applied to Cloud OS. You do not have to cover all of them, but any sub-topic that is relevant should be covered. 
    - Virtual Memory
    - Caching
    - File System
    - Command Line Interface
    - Threading
    - Interrupts
- When should a distributed file system be used?
- When should a distributed file system NOT be used?
